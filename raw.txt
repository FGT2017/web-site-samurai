Creating the goals around this age and the periods
The age when Samurai’s came around began what is called a Feudal War pit against clans to gain the power of the Shogunate. Famous people such as Nobunaga Oda, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, Yukimura Sanada, and Ieyasu Tokugawa played the major role in unifying Japan. Yukimura the heir to the Sanada clan, was a fearless warrior who fought against many Daimyo, he would led a desperate defense of Osaka Castle and soon be killed by Ieyasu army. Nobunaga the leader of the Oda clan, conquered central Japan to only be killed by his retainer, Mitsuhide Akechi. Hideyoshi the leader of the Toyotomi clan, killed Mitsuhide and he conquered all of Japan unifying it. After his death, Ieyasu the leader of the Tokugawa clan, led the Eastern army and Hideyoshi advisor, Mitsunari led the Western army. Ieyasu defeated the Eastern army and placing the Toyotomi under supervision. But their attempted rebellion against the Tokugawa rules led to the end of the Toyotomi and began the Edo Period.
